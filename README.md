# Library-Management-System

In this project for a library management system, you can input new book records and obtain information about books that are currently on hand. You can provide the books to the pupils and keep track of their progress. Students who return issued books after the due date are assessed a late fee.Â Students are only given one book. Students who have not returned their previous book will not be given a new one.
